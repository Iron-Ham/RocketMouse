## SRS

In contributing to the SRS, the only requirement is that you change the .tex file. If you have LaTeX tools installed,
then feel free to use whichever text editor you prefer. If you do not have any LaTeX tools installed, use WriteLatex.com 
to edit the .tex file. Before each commit, it is *imperative* that you test to see if the .tex file compiles! *.aux and *.log
files are unnecessary to upload, and the *.pdf should be updated regularly. If you are unfamiliar with LaTeX and need a 
"cheat sheet", I highly recommend [this one](http://www.stdout.org/~winston/latex/latexsheet-a4.pdf). This cheat-sheet does not 
cover external packages. If you have need for an external package, do not hesitate to use it but *do* state the reason that it is 
being added in your commit log.
