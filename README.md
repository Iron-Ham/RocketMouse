## SRS

##### Using Latex

In contributing to the SRS, the only requirement is that you change the .tex
file. If you have LaTeX tools installed, then feel free to use whichever text
editor you prefer. If you do not have any LaTeX tools installed, use
ShareLatex.com to edit the .tex file. Before each commit, it is *imperative*
that you test to see if the .tex file compiles! *.aux and *.log files are
unnecessary to upload, and the *.pdf should be updated regularly. If you are
unfamiliar with LaTeX and need a cheat sheet, I highly recommend
[this one](http://www.stdout.org/~winston/latex/latexsheet-a4.pdf). This
cheat-sheet does not cover external packages. If you have need for an external
package, do not hesitate to use it but _do_ state the reason that it is being
added in your commit log.

#####Compiling LaTeX:
XeLaTex (XeTex) is being used to compile because it supports a wider range of
characters beyond plain English numbers & letters, and includes support for
modern font formats.
