## SRS

##### Using Latex

In contributing to the SRS, the only requirement is that you change the .tex file. If you have LaTeX tools installed, then feel free to use whichever text editor you prefer. If you do not have any LaTeX tools installed, use ShareLatex.com to edit the .tex file. Before each commit, it is _imperative_ that you test to see if the .tex file compiles! \*.aux and \*.log  must not be uploaded, and the \*.pdf should be updated regularly. If you are unfamiliar with LaTeX and need a cheat sheet, I highly recommend [this one](http://www.stdout.org/~winston/latex/latexsheet-a4.pdf).

#####Compiling LaTeX:
XeLaTex (XeTex) is being used to compile because it supports a wider range of characters beyond plain English numbers & letters, and includes support for modern font formats.

## Application Development Tools

We are developing using [Unity](http://unity3d.com/unity/multiplatform/mobile). 
Languages that Unity accepts for Android development are: C/C++, C#, and Java.
