\title{System Requirements Specification for:\\ UNTITLED GAME (Project Walrider?)}

\author1{Hesham H. Salman } %I need to look up the styling for multiple authors. Didn't have internet at the time so I couldn't look it up.

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Overall Description}



Clearly state purpose of the project.
By whom and how it will be used

This code is for the developers

\subsection{Definitions}

Acronyms and abbreviations as applicable

\subsection{References}

References to other documents

\subsection{Overview of Developer's Responsibilities}

Responsibilities in terms of development, installation, training, maintenance
etc.

Eg. The developer is responsible for development, installation,
loading of all the data relating to books in the library,
and training of employees.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{General Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}

Relationship with other products and principal interfaces

Eg.  This product will interface with the existing database of staff/student
information.  There are four main interfaces.  One for book issual/return
and fines, one for querying of books, one for adding/deleting books, 
and one for administration of users.

\subsection{Product Functions Overview}

A library example.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Book issue and return
\item Fine calculation and collection
\item Adding and deleting books 
\item Querying to find books
\item Report generation 
\item Automatic late book reminder
\end{enumerate} 

\subsection{User Characteristics}

Who the users are, and what training they may need

\subsection{General Constraints}

About schedule, resources, cost etc.

Eg. This project is to be completed, including coding, testing and loading of
the database, by Nov 11, 2008.  A prototype demo is due on Oct 21, 2008.

\section{Information Description}

\subsection{Entities and Relationships}

Give a list of entities/relationships that are needed,
and ER diagrams.

\subsection{Data Dictionary}

Give the relations, their attributes, and for each attribute the
type and a description of the attribute.  Here's an example.

\begin{enumerate}
\item customers

\centerline{
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|p{3in}|}
\hline 
account\_no& varchar(8)& primary key& account number\\
\hline 
name& varchar(20)& not null& Name\\
\hline 
profession& varchar(10)& not null& Profession\\
\hline 
address& varchar(40)& not null& Address\\
\hline 
email& varchar(40)& -& Email Address \\
\hline 
\end{tabular}
}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Flow}

Give data flow between major units of your software.
E.g., 
Most useful in case a task has multiple steps requiring interaction
with other software or other humans.
E.g. To purchase a book, user can enter request, department head can
approve, then librarian approves, then order is made.

\section{Functional Requirements}

Give a description of each process/function.
Start from what happens when the user connects to the system.
E.g.  The main screen and alternatives available to choose from would be 
a functional requirement.
Authentication when entering the system would be another.
An interface to issue a book would be a third.

Have one subsection for each functional requirement.

\subsection{Functional Requirement 1}


Note what a particular functionality does.
Make sure to also note what happens in special cases such as 
out of stock.

\subsection{Functional Requirement 2}

...

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{External Interface Requirements}

\subsection{User Interfaces}

This used to be important, and required a user manual giving commands
screen formats, outputs, error messages, etc.
In your case just say the web is used as interface.

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}

Interfaces with existing as well as new or special purpose hardware.
E.g. smart card reader for authentication.
In your case say no special hardware.

\subsection{Software Interfaces}

List software platforms that are to be supported.

List interfaces with other software packages etc.
Make sure to list all software that you interface with.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Performance Requirements}

Capacity requirements (estimates of no of users, database size, ..)
Response time requirements (for different tasks)
and throughput (estimates of avg/peak number of transactions per minute, etc).
Don't worry about exact numbers but give ballpark figures.

 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Design Constraints}

\subsection{Standards Compliance}

Software development standards asn well as organizational standards
(eg reports, auditing).

In your case, say not applicable.

\subsection{Hardware Limitations}

Requirements on machines, operating systems, storage capacities etc.
This used to be very important, but these days this matters only
for very fast/highthroughput systems, not so much for the things you
are doing.

Fault tolerance and reliability requirements should also be listed here.

In your case this is not considered
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Validation Criteria}

Validation criteria for demonstrating 
successful implementation and user acceptance.  
In general includes classes of tests and expected software response.

E.g. I will load the database with X amount of data for testing,
and an overview of tests you will run.
